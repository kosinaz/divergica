# Divergica's Magical Mushroom Melodies

Divergica's Magical Mushroom Melodies is an enchanting rhythm game designed for kids that combines music, creativity, and a touch of whimsical art. Players embark on a journey with Divergica, a mischievous fairy whose job is to bring color and rhythm to the mushroom grove. However, Divergica has a penchant for deviating from the magical beat, adding some unexpected but delightful extra color to the sweet melodies!

Gameplay:
* Players join Divergica in her quest to color mushrooms by tapping along the rhythm.
* Each level presents more and more mushrooms to color and a catchy melody to follow.
* First, the buckets drop in a random rhytm, and some musical notes play as they hit the ground. Then comes the players' turn, as they need to repeat what they heard, tapping on the screen following the same rhythm.
* But beware! Divergica loves to add twists and turns, so players must stay on their toes and adapt to her playful deviations. They need to look for buckets with extra paint, and tap twice whenever they see them.
* Divergica also hates the black color, so she skips those buckets.
* If you fail a part of a level, you can retry that part, but only 3 times for the whole level.
* Successfully coloring the mushrooms on the rhythm earns points, gold, fairy fronds and unlocks new levels.
* Gold can be spent on power-ups, such as extra buckets for more retries, magic potions for each color to boost gold income, and enchanted wings to play the rhythm slower.
* Fairy fronds are rare, as they are awarded only for perfect levels. They can be spent on cosmetics and customizations.
